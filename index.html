      <h6 class="docs-header">Who are we?</h6>
      <p>Code Air is an app and website development team, capable handingling full stack development and design. Based out of Vancouver, BC we run our business like we would fly our planes. Provide good planning, follow our checklists, and be preapred for changes. We make sure your website or app is lightweight yet usable, making sure you have the features you need while keeping things snappy even on older devices. Most of all, it's the dedication that we have to our craft that makes Code Air different from any other development company.</p>

      <p>Code Air has a one client policy, this is because it's how app/web development actually works. When we are working on your project, we are thinking about it all the time. There is no way to bill for hours when we are thinking about your project while flying to Tofino or while we are in the shower, and we don't want to be distracted by different projects while we do that. When you choose Code Air, you are chosing a first class experience where we are dedicated to you.</p>

    <div class="docs-section" id="cost">
      <h6 class="docs-header">Our costs</h6>
      <p>Every project is different, but our general rule of thumb is $2000USD per week, and we work in one week increments (this becomes more flexible after the first week). Our goal is to provide a detailed outline of our tasks and how long it will take, and that's when your project will be done by. Keeping with our first class experience, ensuring constant communication and adjusting for changes will always be accomodated.</p>

      <p>In addition, to keep our weekly costs low we have an opening consultation fee of $100USD which includes a basic web mockup and some design ideas. Be cautious of services who offer free initial consultations, it takes time to develop a plan and provide mockup graphics. Either you are not going to have a full idea of what you are going to get, or you risk getting an inferrior final product without time and dedication to the opening consultation.</p>

      <h6>Aviation Weather</h6>
      <p>This was a mockup done to show how to beautifully design an aviation weather app. It also shows the balance between sacraficing what might be visually right and providing a better user experience, such as making fonts a little bigger to be more easily seen by the user. This app is designed to give the most important details in flight planning in a beautiful and fast way while relegating less important information elsewhere to avoid distractions.</p>

      <p>This app could be developed in two weeks, and be in both android and iOS app stores <em>in less than a month</em></p>

      <h6>Van AEDs</h6>
      <p>Volunteering for a local church, this project is set up to help Vancouverites know where their nearest AED is located. This is a full stack development, using database design (MySQL), server side code, app side code, a website, marketing, logo design, and continuing support for the server.</p>

      <p>This app is in development, and is currently on hold by our client. Once we have the go-head to finish, we will have the full app done in 3 weeks. This project is a full stack project and shows our skills in all areas of development.</p>

      <h6>Live Together</h6>
      <p>Tied into the Van AED app, this is an app for volunteer first responders to come assist in emergencies. Not only have we developed a full stack backend for this project, we have also have developed a program that runs in the background which monitors local emergency radio frequencies. When something is needed for a project, we can develop it.</p>

      <p>This app is in development, and is currently on hold by our client. Once we have the go-head to finish, we will have the full app done in 4 weeks. This project is a full stack project and shows our skills in all areas of development.</em></p>
