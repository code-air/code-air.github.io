      <h6 class="docs-header">Who are we?</h6>
      <p>Code Air is an app and website development team, capable handling full stack development and design. Based out of Vancouver, BC we build apps the way engineers build planes: high performance, careful design and a zero tolerance approach to imperfect functionality. Provide good planning, follow our checklists, and be prepared for changes. We make sure your website or app is lightweight yet usable, making sure you have the features you need while keeping things snappy even on older devices. Most of all, it's the dedication that we have to our craft that makes Code Air different from any other development company.</p>

      <p>Code Air has a one client policy; we do this because each of us has experienced working on teams stretched between multiple projects, with the consequent reduction in quality this brings: and we don’t like it. When we are working on your project, we are thinking about it all the time. When we build your application, we’re working on it in the shower, while we are walking the streets buying groceries – because it’s always on our mind. You aren’t billed for these hours, they are just a side effect of single project focus. It’s the way we enjoy working. When you choose Code Air, you are choosing the first class cabin where you are the only passenger.

    <div class="docs-section" id="cost">
      <h6 class="docs-header">Our costs</h6>
      <p>Every project is different, but our general rule of thumb is $2000USD per week, and our rates are prorated after the first week. Our goal is to provide a detailed outline of our tasks and how long it will take, we stick to our quotes – if we get it wrong, you’ll get the over time for free – if we finish early, you won’t have to pay for the time not used. Our development style is agile – we’ll be coming to you for feedback from early on in the process to ensure each small step along the way is along exactly the path you want to walk.
</p>

      <p>In addition, to keep our weekly costs low we have an opening consultation fee of $100USD which includes a basic web mock-up and some design ideas. Be cautious of services who offer free initial consultations, it takes time to develop a plan and provide mock-up graphics. Either you are not going to have a full idea of what you are going to get, or you risk getting an inferior final product without time and dedication to the opening consultation.

      <h6>Aviation Weather</h6>
      <p>This was a mockup done to show how to beautifully design an aviation weather app. It also shows the balance between sacraficing what might be visually right and providing a better user experience, such as making fonts a little bigger to be more easily seen by the user. This app is designed to give the most important details in flight planning in a beautiful and fast way while relegating less important information elsewhere to avoid distractions.</p>

      <p>This app could be developed in two weeks, and be in both android and iOS app stores <em>in less than a month</em></p>

      <h6>Van AEDs</h6>
      <p>Volunteering for a local church, this project is set up to help Vancouverites know where their nearest AED is located. This is a full stack development, using database design (MySQL), server side code, app side code, a website, marketing, logo design, and continuing support for the server.</p>

      <p>This app is in development, and is currently on hold by our client. Once we have the go-head to finish, we will have the full app done in 3 weeks. This project is a full stack project and shows our skills in all areas of development.</p>

      <h6>Live Together</h6>
      <p>Tied into the Van AED app, this is an app for volunteer first responders to come assist in emergencies. Not only have we developed a full stack backend for this project, we have also have developed a program that runs in the background which monitors local emergency radio frequencies. When something is needed for a project, we can develop it.</p>

      <p>This app is in development, and is currently on hold by our client. Once we have the go-head to finish, we will have the full app done in 4 weeks. This project is a full stack project and shows our skills in all areas of development.</em></p>
